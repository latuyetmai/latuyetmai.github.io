# Game Design with Python OOP: KWAII LOTTERY

## Overview

In this project, I created a lottery game with Kwaii symbols using Object Oriented Programing (OOP) structures with Python. To start the game, a player could run the python file kwaii_lotter.py in a terminal, and follow the game instructions. The player could buy a ticket and choose different ticket designs to play with. There are 3 algorithms running behind the scene which decide the probability of the player to win the game. Further details and game design could be found in the Game Design Overview document.
