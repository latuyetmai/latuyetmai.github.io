# Sanfrancisco Bikeshare - Data Analysis

-----

In this project, I will answer some business-driven questions using the public datasets housed in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The main objectives is to offer recommendations to increase ridership, and improve profits for Lyft Bay Wheels (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels), formerly known as Ford GoBike, the company running Bay Area Bikeshare.

This project has been broken down into 3 parts:

- In Part 1, I will query using the Google BigQuery GUI interface in the cloud.

- In Part 2, I will query using the Linux command line from my virtual machine in the cloud.

- In Part 3, I will query from a Jupyter Notebook, save the results into Pandas, and present a report enhanced by Pandas output tables and perform data visualizations using Seaborn / Matplotlib.
