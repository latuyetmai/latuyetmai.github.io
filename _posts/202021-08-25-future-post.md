Hello!

My name is Mai La and welcome to my Data Science portfolio. You are currently in the master branch with some brief overviews of my projects. To access the full projects, please navigate to the [projects branch](https://github.com/latuyetmai/mla-folio/tree/projects).

Most projects were originated from the courses that I took from the Master of Information and Data Science degree (MIDS) at the University of Califorina, Berkeley. Therefore, the `projects` branch has been hidden to prevent future students from using search engines and copying.
