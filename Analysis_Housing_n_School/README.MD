# Data Analysis: Home Price & Academic Performance In Los Angeles

## Overview

In this project, we analysed the house price and various academic performance metrics in Los Angeles Metropolitan (LA) using Zillow and published State datasets. Our analysis will provide insights of how housing value correlates to school academic performance and if school has any impact on the house price increasing over the years. Further details could be found in the report document and presentation.
